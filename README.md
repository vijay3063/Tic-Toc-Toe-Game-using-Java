# Tic Toc Toe Game using Java

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe Game project🕹! This is a classic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game developed using Java. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid, with the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) winning the game. This project showcases fundamental programming concepts including array manipulation, control flow, and user input handling. The game provides an interactive console-based interface where players take turns to input their moves. The game board is updated and displayed after each move, and it checks for win conditions after each player's turn. If a player wins, a congratulatory message is displayed, and if a move is invalid, the player is prompted to try again.

This project is entirely written in Java and uses basic Java libraries such as Scanner for handling user input. The simplicity of this implementation makes it a great starting point for beginners looking to understand the basics of game development and Java programming. Let's connect and collaborate on more exciting projects. Happy Gaming! 🎉✨
